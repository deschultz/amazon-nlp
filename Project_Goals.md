# End Goal
The end goal of our project is to create a topic modeling algorithmn that will output more logical topics than those created by Amazon's Comprehend. This model will persist via Amazon Sagemaker and will automatically assign topics to comments as they are surfaced in a pre-defined defined S3 bucket.
